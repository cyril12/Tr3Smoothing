## About
This application is used to smooth the curves generated by [Fie](http://audilab.bme.mcgill.ca/~funnell/AudiLab/sw/fie.html), an image segmentation application which allows users to trace an object's outline at various 2D planes using consecutive image slices of the object. The input and output is a .tr3 file, which stores meta information about the segmentations along with the segmentations themselves each as a set of points on one of the vertical planes. The output of this application can be loaded back into Fie for further editing, or into [Tr3](http://audilab.bme.mcgill.ca/~funnell/AudiLab/sw/tr3.html), which generates a 3D model in the VRML file format.

The application is able to run 32-bit and 64-bit Windows, Mac, and Linux systems. However, the following dependancies must be installed for the application to run:
* One of the follwing
  * [.NET Framework](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows) (select runtime version) Windows only
  * [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/linux) (select runtime version) Windows, macOS, and Linux
  * [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/download/#download-win) Windows, macOS, and Linux
  
## Getting Started
First install Fie and Tr3, which are linked above. Afterwords ensure you have installed the .NET Framework SDK version if on Windows, or either the .NET Core SDK version or Mono if using Linux (ensure the mono-devel package is installed, as it contains the C# compiler). For IDEs, it is recommended to use either [MonoDevelop](http://www.monodevelop.com/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). For those who prefer to use their own text editor, for building you'll want to look into [MSBuild](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd393574.aspx) on Windows or [dotnet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build?tabs=netcore2x) if using .NET Core on Linux or [xbuild](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/tools+libraries/tools/xbuild/) if using Mono on Linux.
