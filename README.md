## About
This application is used to smooth the curves generated by [Fie](http://audilab.bme.mcgill.ca/~funnell/AudiLab/sw/fie.html), an image segmentation application which allows users to trace an object's outline at various 2D planes using consecutive image slices of the object. The smoothing is done on meshes generated from a .tr3 file, using the results to modify the original .tr3 file.

This project is written in C#, using the .NET runtimes. For the UI, [gtk#](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/gui/gtksharp/) is used, and the graphics are implemented in OpenGL using [OpenTK](https://github.com/opentk/opentk) bindings.

## Running the Application
The application is able to run 32-bit and 64-bit Windows and Linux systems. However, dependancies must be installed for the application to run:
* [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/download/)
* Gtk
  * [Windows](http://www.mono-project.com/download/#download-win)
  * Linux - Install gtk-sharp2 package
  
On Windows systems the application can be launced using any usual method.

On linux it should be run using mono as follows:
```
mono SoSmooth.exe
```
  
## Getting Started
First install Fie and Tr3, which are linked above. Afterwords ensure you have installed the .NET Framework SDK version if on Windows, or Mono if using Linux (check that the mono-devel package is installed, as it contains the C# compiler).

### Building
To build the application on Windows, first add the directory containing MSBuild.exe to the system PATH enviroment variable.
Then you can run the build.cmd script located in the root folder. The build output will be located under the SoSmooth/bin/ directory.

On Linux, simply run the build.sh script.
