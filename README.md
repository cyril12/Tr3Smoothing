## About
This application is used to smooth the curves generated by [Fie](http://audilab.bme.mcgill.ca/~funnell/AudiLab/sw/fie.html), an image segmentation application which allows users to trace an object's outline at various 2D planes using consecutive image slices of the object. The input and output is a .tr3 file, which stores meta information about the segmentations along with the segmentations themselves each as a set of points on one of the vertical planes. The output of this application can be loaded back into Fie for further editing, or into [Tr3](http://audilab.bme.mcgill.ca/~funnell/AudiLab/sw/tr3.html), which generates a 3D model in the VRML file format.

This project is written in C#, using the .NET runtimes. For the UI, [gtk#](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/gui/gtksharp/) is used, and the graphics are implemented in OpenGL using [OpenTK](https://github.com/opentk/opentk) bindings.

The application is able to run 32-bit and 64-bit Windows and Linux systems. However, dependancies must be installed for the application to run:
* One of the following
  * [.NET Framework](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows) (select runtime version) - Windows only
  * [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/download/#download-win) - Windows and Linux
* [Gtk#](http://www.mono-project.com/download/#download-win) - Windows only, Linux generally includes gtk out of the box
  
## Getting Started
First install Fie and Tr3, which are linked above. Afterwords ensure you have installed the .NET Framework SDK version if on Windows, or Mono if using Linux (check that the mono-devel package is installed, as it contains the C# compiler).
